Hello!

Here, I will be attempting to create my own API framework from scratch using Express.js

As I complete this task, I will be updating the README to document all the steps I undertook in order to get it working.  Stay tuned and (hopefully) you'll see me progress!

### Study Notes
To help me with this task, I have used the following resources, along with my own notes that I handwrote during the lecture:
| [JavaScript API Frameworks](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API-Frameworks) | [Testing API Endpoints with Supertest](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/API-Endpoint-Testing-with-Supertest) |

### Steps to create my API server
To create my API server, I did the following:
1. Initialize a new repository containing just a README file (this one!)
2. `cd` into the repo and create a new folder directory called "server" (this is where all my code and files related to just the server side will be stored)
3. Install express
    - `cd server` (this ensures express is installed inside the server folder)
    - `npm init`
    - `npm install express --save`
    - Remember to add node_modules to .gitignore
